Link Router
==============

Link Router is an extension for the Chrome browser. It helps sort links into categories with minimal effort.

Link Router uses Chrome's context menu (right click menu) to tag a link with a tag specified in the menu.  The available tags in the menu are configured in the extension's option page.  Previously tagged links are also visible on the options page, where they can be copied and pasted to other destinations.
